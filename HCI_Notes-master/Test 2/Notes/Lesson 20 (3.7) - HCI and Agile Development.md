# Lesson 20

- In this lesson, we will cover how we might use agile development methods to engage in quicker feedback cycles.
- New methods for HCI - earlier delivery, continous improvement, rapid feedback cycles.

## The Demand For Rapid Hci

Before, costs for development, distribution, and feedback regarding software and products were expensive compared to now.
	- Speacialized development skills
	- Distribution is physical
	- Fix was hard
	- By have users to come into testing

How do we take the principles we have covered so far and apply them to a rapid agile development process?
	- Cheap development
	- Internet distribution - Free and update
	- Usage data is free and live. Lots of feedback
	- More incentive to build and save

## When To Go Agile?

We can make the decision to go agile by considering the following:

|                   | Traditional | Agile      |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Criticality is... | High        | Low        | Healthcare and Financial are not considered
| Requirements is.. | Rarely      | Frequently | Thermostat vs udacity
| Team size is...   | Large       | Small      |
| Team embraces...  | Order       | Change     |

Similarities and Differences Between UCD and Agile Development

- They rely on an iterative development process, building on empirical information from previous cycles or rounds. For instance, one of XP’s values is feedback ([2:20]), and the idea of refactoring code is an embodiment of this value. In UCD one of its founding principles is iterative design
- Agile techniques place an emphasis on the user, encouraging participation
throughout the development process. For instance, in Scrum, user evaluation of the product is encouraged on a monthly basis as users are ideally present during the sprint review ([16:54]) and the “Product Owner” is responsible for the requirements and feature prioritisation for the product. A second founding principle of UCD, is early and continual focus on users.
- Both approaches emphasise the importance of team coherence. Beck states that one of the purposes of the planning game is to “bring the team together” ([2:85]). One of the features of the UCD approach is that the whole team should have the user in mind while developing the product.

The two main differences are:
1. UCD advocates maintain that certain design products are required to support
communication with developers, while agile methods seek minimal documentation.
2. UCD encourages the team to understand their users as much as possible before the
product build begins, whereas agile methods are largely against an up-front period
of investigation at the expense of writing code. 

## Live Prototyping
- Optimizely - Drag and drop interface. Small revision its awesome. Benefit is high. 
- Final interface vs Prototype
- Allows to get feedback

## A/B Testing
- Rapid software testing between two changes. B version to small users and change as positive before to all.
- Real user testing

## Agile HCI In The Design Life Cycle

Agile development techniques don't replace the design life cycle, they just change the rate at which we go through it and the types of prototypes and evaluation that we actually do. We're still going to do the initial need-finding step.

## 5 Tips: Mitigating Risk In HCI And Agile Development

1. Start more traditional - Once you have something up and running, move to agile
2. Focus on small changes - Dont make huge change
3. Adopt a parallel track method - 2 week sprints, have HCI one sprint ahead.
4. Be careful with consistency - Dont mess with user expectation
5. Nest your design cycles - Small cyles rapidly in Agile
