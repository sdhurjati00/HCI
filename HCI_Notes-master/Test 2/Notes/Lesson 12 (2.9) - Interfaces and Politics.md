# Lesson 12

In this lesson, we will cover interfaces and politics:
-Langdon winner - techincal devices have politics? Create change in world.

- **Politics** - Whether artifacts can personify specific forms of authority or power, whether good or bad
Two dimensions of politics:

1. Designing for change
2. Anticipating change from our designs

We will also touch on _value-sensitive design_.

## Change: A Third Motivation

There are three goals of HCI:

1. Help a user do a task
2. Understand how a user does a task
3. Change the way the user does a task

Car - Seatbelt example - Not usability but safety.

## Paper - Do artifcats have politics?

- Nuclear Power 
	- Can be used in Totalitarian. Push for tech carries politics
	- Solara power equalitarian society

### Two types
- Inhrently political
	- Nuclear power (top down)-  Authoritarian
	- Solar Power (distribiuted) - Egalitarian society
- Technical arrangements as forms of order
	- Technology can change social order - Context and purpose - Busting unions. 

## Change By Design

- Ability of interfaces to change behavior can be abused.
- Normal designs with underlying politics
	- People can design things to intentionally create a negative (designing bridges too low so that it's harder for poor people to go to a destination) or positive change (Facebook's _like_ button).
	- Wealthy people can go to park, low bridges for poor people (social order) ,Net neutrality
	- Positive interactions. Like button and Emotions in FB. Societal trend.


## Change By Happenstance
- Need not always by design. Bycycle - Societal change
	- Women using cycle instead relying on someone, wardroobe change.
- While people could intentionally create a positive or negative design, this could happen unintentionally as well for positive (the bicycle giving women freedom to travel independently) and negative (internet access) cases.
- Existing Infrastructure and Internet

## Value-sensitive Design

Value-sensitive design seeks to provide theory and method to account for human values in a principled and systematic manner throughout the design process.
- Privacy by design - Privacy is the value. Preserve value.

## Value-sensitive Design and Information Systems

- Conceptual Investigations - Thought experiments, role value play in stakehplders
- Empricial Investigations - target users - exploring how they make sense of values 
- Technical Investigation - target systems - 

Fundamental feature - Proactive, usability vs human values, 

##  Value-sensitive Design Across Cultures
One of the challenges of value-sensitive design is that values are different across cultures (culture that values privacy vs cultures that value frees speech due to censorship).

- Right to be forgotten, value held by EU. Google was not developed based on that.
- Not universally shared.
- Privacy vs Free speech.

## 5 Tips: Value-sensitive Design

1. Start early - Identify values early on design process and check throughout
2. Know your users - Know user values. Challenges are to be identified.
3. Consider both direct and indirect stakeholder - People who dont user but affected by it. Bank UI.
4. Brainstorm the interface's possibilities - How it could be used. Tracking hours - unjust call for termination.
5. Choose carefully between supporting values and prescribing values - We shouldnt prescribe values for everyone. Be careful about support and change

## Reversing The Relationship

Technology changes society but society could also change technology too (e.g., demand for single platform to link to others for TV subscriptions).

Bulbs - florecent bulbs vs Electrictity Bill 
	- Satisfaction of politics, preserve power of organization.

## Section Quizzes

### Design Challenge: Change By Design

_Design an app for Morgan that would encourage her to get up and move more frequently without explicitly telling her to do so._

One such app could be a social media app where users in the same city share pictures of the city. This application could encourage Morgan to go out and take pictures of the things around her.

## Reflections: Interfaces And Politics

_Think of an instance where some technology you use was designed with political motivation in mind._

When using Piazza, there is clearly a push to use their job search tool since they always push it on the landing page.
