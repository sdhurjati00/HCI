## A Framework for the Experience of Meaning in Human-Computer Interaction

> Mekler, E. & Hornbæk, K. (2019). A Framework for the Experience of Meaning in Human-Computer Interaction. In Proceedings of the 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems. ACM.

Topic:  present a framework of meaning in interaction, based on a synthesis of psychological meaning research. The framework outlines five distinct
senses of the experience of meaning: connectedness, purpose, coherence, resonance, and significance. 

### Summary
- What makes interaction good? The answers to this question are steadily evolving in human-computer interaction.
- Past included consistency, transparency, usability, and positive emotions
- Some researchers even argue that computers struggle to support and might easily undermine meaning.
- Problem:  it is difficult to design for, assess, evaluate or simply discuss meaning as a quality of good interaction.
	- We present a framework that outlines the components of meaning as an experience in interaction: connectedness, purpose, coherence, resonance, and significance. These components are oriented toward the self/the world, motivation, understanding, feeling/intuition, and evaluation. They are based on a synthesis of psychological research on meaning in life, meaning-making, and meaning maintenanc

- Hassenzahl et al. [41] called for design to focus on affording moments of meaning, and argued that meaning stems from the extent a product satisfies various psychological needs.
- What makes a good interaction - Answers to this question serve to advance theory in HCI and may ultimately influence measures, methodology, and design
- Thus both experience during interaction as well as outcomes that endure beyond the moment-to-moment interaction are valid answers to the question about goodness
- Meaning is a complicated word; fleshing out our understand- ing of it in relation to HCI is the main purpose of this paper. But to avoid misunderstandings, we outline a few distinc- tions that are key to understanding meaning as a quality of interaction. Meaning is typically used akin to a form of fulfillment [69], worth [19], or ‘goodness’ [28] of interaction. This is similar to the use in “a meaningful experience”, “finding meaning in an activity”, or “to be engaged in meaning- making”. Thereby, meaning may be applied to objects, ex- periences, activities, and behavior.
- Recent works Tend to share an interest in meaning and in human experiences, momentary or long-term, ofusing or living with a digital product or service, often termed the ‘user experi- enc

#### MEANING FRAMEWORK

- The framework was developed by reviewing the works of contemporary meaning scholars within existential ex- perimental and positive psychology. In particular, we focus on research on meaning in life, meaning-making and meaning maintenance, which are of particular relevance to HCI

The key idea of the framework is that the experience of meaning consists of five distinct, albeit related components – connectedness, purpose, coherence, resonance, and signifi- cance.



### Assumptions of the Framework


- meaning as a moment-to-moment experience. While much psychological research focuses on people’s global as- sessment of meaning in life, this is largely derived from their daily and situational experiences ofmeaning
- second assumption is that our framework conceptual- izes meaning as a chiefly subjective experience. Rather than being objectively given in the world, we understand meaning as something personal, which must be subjectively gener- ated
- third assumption is that despite its vast and seemingly abstract nature, the experience of meaning is not ineffable. While the sources of meaning (i.e., what is experienced as meaningful) are manifold and may differ over time and from person to person [23, 99], the experience of meaning is uni- versal [34, 45, 61, 78]. While we are wary of reductionist

### Purpose

- purpose, we refer to having a sense of direction [78, 83, 102], perceiving one’s current activities as having clear ends to strive towards [32, 34], as well as seeing how they are linked to future events [7, 75]

- Purpose is therefore also referred to as the motivational component of meaning [78, 92, 99], and may be considered the future- oriented component of meaning. We question purpose when we ask “Why is this happening to me?” or “Why am I doing this?

### Connectedness

- connectedness we refer to the fact that the experience of meaning always connects beyond the immediate experience

- opposite of connectedness is self-alienation

- Meaning does not simply emerge from a vacuum, – all experience of meaning connects to aspects of the self and the world we are in

- For example, many people report meaningful experiences involving video games [88],those games have a personal connection. For others, video games constitute at best a pleasant, yet ultimately meaning- less pastime [84], precisely because their experiences lack these connections

- people sharing the same cultures, experiences, ideologies, and be- liefs may consider similar experiences meaningful

### Coherence

coherence to denote the extent to which one’s ex- periences make sense [7, 34, 45, 54, 78, 99, 110]. The sense of coherence results from thinking about those experiences and understanding them in relation to life as a whole. It is the moment when we exclaim “I see what you did there” or state “that made sense to me”.

We question coherence when we ask ourselves “what is happening to me?” For instance, as absurd as it may seem to our friends that we structure vacation and work time around the CHI deadline, it makes sense to us—most of the time at least—as it is coherent with our identity as HCI researchers, our goal to write a good paper, and our previous experiences in doing so

### Significance

significance as the sense that our expe- riences and actions at a given moment feel important and worthwhile, yet also consequential and enduring [7, 34, 62, 78]. In short, the experience underlines that our existence is non-trivial. It is when we state that things “matter” and “make a difference”. For instance, some activities and expe- riences bring us little to no pleasure—in fact, we might feel quite ambivalent or even bad about them. Yet we deem them deeply important: Breaking up with an estranged partner, or dedicating considerable time and effort to improve a work that hardly anyone will ever see

### Resonance 

We use resonance to denote the immediate, unreflected expe- rience of something making sense [54], without the need to reflect on why or how it does so, or being able to explain it. We assert “what is happening now feels right” [44, p. 473] or that something just “clicks” with us [54], indicating a special fit or connection. For example, we might have an intuition, a positive ‘gut feeling’, that what we are doing and experi- encing right now is ‘right’: Reading a poem or gazing at a beautiful landscape might resonate strongly with us. Perhaps we know more than we can tell [44], such as when practicing yoga, one notices that the pose feels ‘right’


While conscious and more active reflective pro- cesses are often central to research on meaning, compre- hension and sense-making [34, 43, 91, 96], the notion of resonance has received far less attention.

In short, while coherence is about understanding how one’s experiences fit with what we know about ourselves nd the world, resonance denotes a pronounced feeling of rightness’ that emerges spontaneously in response to one’s ngoing experience connecting with one’s self in some way.

### Relation Among the Components of Meaning

- The five components of meaning are distinct, but it would be inaccurate to see them as separate and orthogonal. Con- nectedness is at the core of the experience of meaning. If our experiences did not connect to anything, we would not be able to make sense of them (coherence), develop any gut feelings (resonance), recognize their purpose to us, or be able to assess their significance in light of our personal values 
- Coherence arguably con- stitutes a necessary condition for purpose, resonance and significance: If we cannot make sense of our experiences, they feel wrong, and it is difficult to evaluate whether they matter to us and set future goals. But a sense of coherence alone will not automatically render our experiences purpose- ful or significant. 
- Importantly, while our framework focuses on the moment- to-moment experience of meaning, it need be reiterated that meaning is never solely about one specific moment in time.

### Relation Among the Components of Meaning

We find a number of those discussions superficial, given the complexity ofmeaning as captured in our framework and in the broader psychological literature

### Discussion

#### Benefits of the Framework

The framework we propose has attempted to do something rarely done in individual papers, including the sample of CHI papers we analyzed: It has created an overview of an important quality of interaction, meaning.

We argue that the framework can also provide some input to design and evaluation. With respect to design, Dourish has noticed that “meaning is a vague term. Connecting it to design will require more precision” [26, p.128]. Distin- guishing the five components in design is useful, and our analysis highlights several avenues for doing so. For example, designers of technologies aimed at making data “meaningful” [53, 98] may not only focus on coherence, but also deliber- ately consider ways for users to perceive data as purposeful, resonant and significant.

Moreover, our framework may also provide the starting point for considering meaning as an experience goal when designing products beyond the work place, as it pro- vides a clearer understanding of the different components and orientations of meaning.

For evaluation, it is a difficult empirical problem to un- derstand what people experience as meaningful interactions with technology; both in terms of assessing meaning qual- itatively and quantitatively and in terms of understanding the contents of their meaning-making.


### Limitation of framework
- Most importantly, because we ground our framework in existential and
positive psychology, we describe meaning as a subjective
experience. However, there is an ongoing discussion, also
in the fields we draw on, whether there is also something
such as objective meaning in the world or intersubjective
meaning
